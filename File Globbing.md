# FILE GLOBBING # 

## CHALLENGE 1: Matching with *

- DOCUMENTATION:
  This talks about the * operator and how it is used as a wildcard and replaces the argument with any pattern that matches
  
- THOUGHT PROCESS:
  IN this challenge we had to cd to the challenge directory but only using an argument of size 4

- SOLUTION:
  I ran this code,
```
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /ch*
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
```
and I received the following output,

  ```
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{IxrllSPwA27BHJvjMBCjUCCNzSE.dFjM4QDLyMDO0czW}
  ```
## CHALLENGE 2: 

- DOCUMENTATION:
  Next, let's learn about ?. When it encounters a ? character in any argument, the shell will treat it as single-character wildcard. This works like *, but only matches one character
  
- THOUGHT PROCESS:
  Starting from your home directory, change your directory to /challenge, but use the ? character instead of c and l in the argument to cd! Once you're there, run /challenge/run for the flag

- SOLUTIONS:  
  I ran this command,
  ```
  ```

  received this output,
  ```

  ```
